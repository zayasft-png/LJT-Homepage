This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of deep learning approaches for video understanding, covering the evolution of methods from traditional computer vision techniques to modern transformer-based architectures. We examine performance trends, methodological innovations, and emerging challenges in the field.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Evolution of video understanding architectures (CNN, RNN, Transformer)
- Temporal modeling techniques and their effectiveness
- Benchmark datasets and evaluation methodologies
- Computational efficiency and scalability considerations
- Applications in action recognition, video classification, and temporal localization

**Major Findings:**
- Transformer-based approaches have significantly outperformed traditional methods
- Multi-scale temporal modeling remains a key challenge
- Computational efficiency improvements are crucial for practical deployment
- Cross-modal learning shows promising results for video-text tasks

This review identifies critical research gaps and proposes future directions to advance the field of video understanding, serving as a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners.
