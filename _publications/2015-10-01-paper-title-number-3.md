This comprehensive survey provides a systematic examination of attention mechanisms in deep neural networks, tracing their evolution from early computational models to modern transformer architectures. We analyze the theoretical foundations and practical implementations that have made attention a cornerstone of contemporary AI systems.

**Key Contributions:**
- Historical evolution of attention mechanisms in neural networks
- Taxonomy of attention types: self-attention, cross-attention, and multi-head attention
- Applications across computer vision, natural language processing, and multimodal tasks
- Computational complexity analysis and optimization strategies
- Future directions and open challenges

The survey demonstrates how attention mechanisms have fundamentally transformed deep learning, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of input data and achieve unprecedented performance across diverse domains.
