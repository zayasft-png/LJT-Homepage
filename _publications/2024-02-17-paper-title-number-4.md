This paper introduces a novel framework for efficient multimodal learning specifically designed for video understanding tasks. We propose a cross-modal attention mechanism that effectively combines visual and temporal information while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple video understanding benchmarks while reducing training time by 40% compared to existing methods.

**Key Contributions:**
- Novel cross-modal attention mechanism for video understanding
- Efficient fusion strategies for multimodal representations  
- Comprehensive evaluation on standard video understanding benchmarks
- Significant improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency

The proposed method demonstrates superior performance across various video analysis tasks including action recognition, video captioning, and temporal localization.
